# Python Games Repository

Welcome to my Python Games Repository! 🎮 This repository contains two exciting games developed using Pygame and basic Python - "Hungry Snake" and "Flappy Bird". These games are designed to showcase game development concepts and demonstrate the usage of Pygame library along with fundamental Python programming skills.

## Games Included:

### 1. Hungry Snake 🐍

Hungry Snake is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat fruits while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries. The snake grows longer as it consumes fruits, challenging the player to strategize and maneuver efficiently.

- **Game Controls:** Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
- **Objective:** Eat fruits to increase the score and grow the snake's length. Be cautious to avoid collisions.
- **How to Play:** Run the Python script and navigate the snake to collect fruits.

### 2. Flappy Bird 🐦

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird to fly through gaps between pipes. The goal is to keep the bird flying without colliding with the pipes or the ground, challenging the player's reflexes and precision.

- **Game Controls:** Use the spacebar key to make the bird flap and ascend.
- **Objective:** Navigate the bird through openings in the pipes to score points. Avoid collisions with obstacles.
- **How to Play:** Execute the Python script and tap the spacebar to keep the bird flying.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Pygame library installed (if not, use `pip install pygame`)

### How to Run the Games

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the respective game's directory (`Hungry Snake` or `Flappy Bird`).
3. Run the Python script for the desired game using a Python interpreter (`python hungry_snake.py` or `python flappy_bird.py`).

Feel free to explore the source code, experiment, and have fun playing these games!

Happy gaming! 🚀🎉
